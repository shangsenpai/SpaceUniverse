            <h2>All about Mercury</h2>
            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It’s just a little bigger than Earth’s moon.<br>
                It is the closest planet to the sun, but it’s actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.<br>
                Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with craters.<br>
                 It has no atmosphere, and it doesn’t have any moons. Mercury likes to keep things simple.
                This small planet spins around slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time.<br>
                 Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. A year on Mercury goes by fast. <br>
                 Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it doesn’t take very long to go all the way around.<br>
                  It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth days.<br>
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>All about Venus</h2>
            <p>
                Venus looks like a very active planet. It has mountains and volcanoes. Venus is similar in size to Earth. Earth is just a little bit bigger.
                <br>
                Venus is unusual because it spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets. And its rotation is very slow. It takes about 243 Earth days to spin around just once. Because it's so close to the Sun, a year goes by fast. It takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all the way around the Sun. That means that a day on Venus is a little longer than a year on Venus.
                <br>
                Since the day and year lengths are similar, one day on Venus is not like a day on Earth. Here, the Sun rises and sets once each day. But on Venus, the Sun rises every 117 Earth days. That means the Sun rises two times during each year on Venus, even though it is still the same day on Venus.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>All about Earth</h2>
            <p>
                Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. Water covers 70% of Earth's surface.
                <br>
                Our atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe. The atmosphere also protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface as meteorites.
                <br>
                Since we live here, you might think we know all there is to know about Earth. Not at all, actually! We have a lot we can learn about our home planet. Right now, there are many satellites orbiting Earth taking pictures and measurements.
                <br>
                 This is how we can learn more about weather, oceans, soil, climate change, and many other important topics.
                 <br>
                 Earth is a terrestrial planet. It is small and rocky.
                <br>
                Earth has lots of spacecraft watching it. There is still a lot we can learn about our home planet.
                <br>
                Earth's atmosphere is the right thickness to keep the planet warm so living things like us can be there. It’s the only planet in our solar system we know of that supports life. It is mostly nitrogen, and it has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe.
            </p>

            <br><br><br>
            <h2>All about Mars</h2>
            <p>
                Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground.
                <br>
                Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.
                <br>
                There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and thin clouds. On some Martian hillsides, there is evidence of liquid salty water in the ground.
                <br>
                Scientists want to know if Mars may have had living things in the past. They also want to know if Mars could support life now or in the future.
                <br>
                Mars has been known since ancient times because it can be seen without advanced telescopes.
                <br>
    	        Several missions have visited Mars. And Mars is the only planet we have sent rovers to. They drive around Mars, taking pictures and measurements.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>All about Jupiter</h2>
            <p>
                Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got massive enough to start burning. It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years. Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about the size of Earth. Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well.
                <br>
                Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system.<br>
                Jupiter is a gas giant. It is made mostly of hydrogen and helium.<br>
                Jupiter has a very thick atmosphere.<br>
                Jupiter has rings, but they’re very hard to see.
                <br>
                Jupiter has been visited or passed by several spacecraft, orbiters and probes, such as Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Cassini, New Horizons, and Juno.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>All about Saturn</h2>
            <p>
                Saturn isn’t the only planet to have rings, but it definitely has the most beautiful ones. The rings we see are made of groups of tiny ringlets that surround Saturn. They’re made of chunks of ice and rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium.
                <br>
                When Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through a telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was seeing. At first he thought he was looking at three planets, or a planet with handles. Now we know those "handles" turned out to be the rings of Saturn.
                <br>
                Saturn has been known since ancient times because it can be seen without advanced telescopes.
                Four robotic spacecraft have visited Saturn, including Pioneer 11, Cassini, and Voyager 1 and 2.
                <br>
            </p>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <h2>All about Uranus</h2>
            <p>
                Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes Uranus blue.
                <br>
                Uranus also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark. The outer rings are brightly colored and easier to see. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction as most other planets. And unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates on its side.
                <br>
                Uranus is surrounded by a set of 13 rings.
                <br>
                Uranus is an ice giant (instead of a gas giant). It is mostly made of flowing icy materials above a solid core.
                Uranus has a thick atmosphere made of methane, hydrogen, and helium.
                <br>
                Uranus is the only planet that spins on its side.
                Uranus spins the opposite direction as Earth and most other planets.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>All about Neptune</h2>
            <p>
                Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system. It's more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth is. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick fog of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane gives Neptune the same blue color as Uranus. Neptune has six rings, but they're very hard to see.
                <br>
                Neptune is encircled by six rings.
                <br>
                Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant. It’s similar to a gas giant. It is made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane flowing over a solid core about the size of Earth.
                Neptune has a thick, windy atmosphere.
                <br>
                Neptune was discovered in 1846 by Urbain Le Verrier, John Couch Adams, and Johann Galle.
                Only Voyager 2 has visited Neptune.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>All about Sun</h2>
            <p>
                A star is a hot, glowing ball of gas. When you look up in the night sky, you can see countless twinkling stars. Can you see any stars during the daytime? Of course! The light of daytime comes from our closest star: the Sun.
                <br>
                Just how close is the Sun to Earth? Way, way closer than other stars, but still pretty far away. It’s approximately 93 million miles away from Earth. That’s 400 times farther than the distance between Earth and the Moon!
                <br>
                However, it’s a good thing that Earth isn’t too close to the Sun. If we were too close, it would be way too hot to live here. The Sun’s surface is very hot, and its atmosphere is even hotter. And the Sun’s core is the hottest part of all, at a sizzling 27 million degrees Fahrenheit!
                <br>
                Our Sun is about 100 times wider than Earth, but it is just an average sized star. Astronomers have found some stars that are 100 times bigger than the Sun and others that are 10 times smaller.
                <br>
                The Sun is also right in the middle of its lifecycle. Right now, our Sun is in a stage called yellow dwarf. It is about 4.5 billion years old. In another 5 billion years the Sun will become a big, cool star called a red giant.
